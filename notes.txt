* What is ORM?
    ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that helps you interact with a database using Java objects instead of writing SQL queries directly.
    üî∏ For example:
    You have a User class in Java.
    Instead of writing SQL queries like SELECT * FROM users, ORM lets you do something like userRepository.findAll() in Java.
    ORM converts:
    Java objects ‚û°Ô∏è Database tables
    Java fields ‚û°Ô∏è Table columns

* What is JPA?
    JPA (Java Persistence API) is a standard or specification for ORM in Java.
    üîπ Think of JPA as a set of rules or interfaces that define how Java objects should be mapped to a database.
    But JPA itself is just a guideline ‚Äî it needs a provider to work (like Hibernate).

* What is Spring Data JPA?
    Spring Data JPA is a part of Spring Framework that makes working with JPA even easier.
    It adds:
        Repository interfaces like CrudRepository, JpaRepository
        Auto implementation of common queries
        Cleaner and faster development
